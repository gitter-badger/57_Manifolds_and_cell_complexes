If $n \neq 4$ then the smooth manifolds homeomorphic to a given topological $n$- manifold, $M$, are parameterized by some discrete algebraic invariant of $M$.  In particular there is a unique smooth manifold homeomorphic to $\R^n$.

\bigskip
By contrast one may choose uncountably many open sets in $\R^4$, which are all homeomorphic to $\R^4$, but which are pairwise non-diffeomorphic.

\bigskip
A smooth manifold homeomorphic to $\R^4$, but not diffeomorphic to it is called an \emph{exotic} $\R^4$.

\bigskip
Given an exotic $\R^4$, $E$, we have a diffeomorphism $E \times \R \to \R^5$.  (As there is only one smooth manifold homeomorphic to $\R^5$).  Hence exotic  $\R^4$'s may be identified with closed submanifolds of $\R^5$.  In particular this means the cardinality of the set of exotic $\R^4$'s is precisely continuum.

\bigskip
Historically, Donaldson's theorem led to the discovery of the Donaldson Freedman exotic $\R^4$.
