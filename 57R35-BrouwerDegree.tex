\begin{document}
Suppose that $M$ and $N$ are two oriented differentiable manifolds
of dimension $n$ (without boundary) with $M$ compact and $N$ connected and suppose that
$f \colon M \to N$ is a differentiable mapping.  Let $Df(x)$ denote the
differential mapping at the point $x \in M$,
that is the linear mapping $Df(x) \colon T_x(M) \to T_{f(x)}(N)$.  Let $\operatorname{sign} Df(x)$ denote the sign
of the determinant of $Df(x)$.  That is the sign is positive if $f$ preserves
orientation and negative if $f$ reverses orientation.

\begin{defn}
Let $y \in N$ be a regular value, then we define the {\em Brower degree} (or just
degree) of $f$ by
\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{deg} f := \sum_{x \in f^{-1}(y)} \operatorname{sign} Df(x) .
\end{equation*}
\end{defn}

It can be shown that the degree does not depend on the regular value $y$ that we pick so that $\operatorname{deg} f$ is well defined.

Note that this degree coincides with the \PMlinkname{degree}{Degree5} as defined for maps of spheres.
