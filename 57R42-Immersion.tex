\begin{document}
Let $X$ and $Y$ be manifolds, and let $f$ be a mapping $f: X \to Y$. Choose $x \in X$, and let $y=f(x)$.  Recall that $df_x: T_x(X) \to T_y(Y)$ is the derivative of $f$ at $x$, and $T_z(Z)$ is the tangent space of manifold $Z$ at point $z$.

If $df_x$ is injective, then $f$ is said to be an \emph{immersion at x}. If $f$ is an immersion at every point, it is called an \emph{immersion}.

If the image of $f$ is also closed, then $f$ is called a \emph{closed immersion}. 

The notion of \PMlinkname{closed immersion}{ClosedImmersion} for schemes is the analog of this notion in algebraic geometry.
