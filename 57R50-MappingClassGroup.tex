\begin{document}
Since the set of diffeomorphisms of a manifold which are \PMlinkname{diffeotopic}{Diffeotopy} to the identity is a normal subgroup of the group of all diffeomorphisms, we can form the quotient of the diffeomorphism group by this subgroup.  This quotient is known as the \emph{ mapping class group}.
