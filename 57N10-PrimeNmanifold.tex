\begin{document}
A \PMlinkname{n-manifold}{TopologicalManifold} $M$ is called \PMlinkescapetext{\emph{prime}} if for all the factorizations of $M$, as a \PMlinkname{connected sum}{ConnectedSum2} $M=M_1\#M_2$, one finds that one of the factors $M_1$ or $M_2$ is the n-sphere $S^n$. 

The importance for 3-manifold is the existence and uniqueness prime decomposition theorem which says: Each 3-manifold can be decomposed as a connected sum of prime manifolds.
