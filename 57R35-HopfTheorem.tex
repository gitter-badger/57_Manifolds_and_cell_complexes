In the following we will assume that the term ``smooth'' implies just $C^1$ (once continuously differentiable).  By smooth homotopy we will \PMlinkescapetext{mean} that the homotopy mapping is itself continuously differentiable

\begin{thm}
Suppose that $M$ is a connected, \PMlinkname{oriented}{Orientation2} smooth manifold without boundary of dimension $m$ and suppose $f,g \colon M \to S^m$ are smooth mappings to the $m$-sphere.  Then $f$ and $g$ are smoothly homotopic if and only if $f$ and $g$ have the same Brouwer degree.
\end{thm}

When $M$ is not orientable, then we can always ``flip'' the orientation by following a closed loop on the manifold and one can then prove the following
result.

\begin{thm}
Suppose that $M$ is not orientable, connected smooth manifold without boundary
of dimension $m$, and suppose $f,g \colon M \to S^m$ are smooth mappings to
the $m$-sphere.
Then $f$ and $g$ are smoothly homotopic if and only if $f$ and $g$ have the
same degree mod 2.
\end{thm}
