Let $K$ denote the simply connected closed 4- manifold given by 

$$
K=\{x:y:z:w \in \C P^3 | x^4+y^4+z^4+w^4=0\}
$$

Let $E_8$ denote the unique rank 8 unimodular symmetric bilinear form over $\Z$, which is positive definite and with respect to which, the norm of any vector is even. Let $B$ denote  the rank 2 bilinear form over $\Z$ which may be represented by the matrix

$$
\left(\begin{array}{cc} 0&1 \\ 1&0 \end{array}\right)
$$

Then we may regard $H_2(K;\Z)$ as a direct sum $M \oplus N$, where the cup product induces the form $E_8 \oplus E_8$ on $M$ and $B \oplus B \oplus B$ on $N$ and we have $M$ orthogonal to $N$.  (This does not contradict Donaldson's theorem as $B$ has 1 and -1 as eigenvalues.)

We may choose a (topological) open ball, $U$, in $\#_3 S^2 \times S^2$ which contains a (topological) closed ball, $V$, such that we have a smooth embedding, $f:\#_3 S^2 \times S^2\,\, - \,\,V \to K$ satisfying the following property:

The map $f$ induces an isomorphism  from $H_2( \#_3 S^2 \times 
S^2\,\, - \,\,U;\Z)$ into the summand $N$ .



If we could smoothly embed $S^3$ into $U - V$, enclosing $V$, then by replacing the outside of the embedded $S^3$ with a copy of $B^4$, and regarding $U-V$ as 
lying in $K$, we obtain a smooth simply connected closed 4- manifold, with 
bilinear form $E_8 \oplus E_8$ induced by the cup product.  This contradicts Donaldson's theorem.

Therefore, $U$ has the property of containing a compact set which is not enclosed by any smoothly embedded $S^3$.  Hence $U$ is an exotic $\R^4$.

By considering the three copies of $B$ one at a time, we could have obtained our exotic $\R^4$ as an open subset of $S^2 \times S^2$.
