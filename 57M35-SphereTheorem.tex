\begin{document}
\begin{thm}[sphere theorem]  If $M$ is a differentiable orientable 3-manifold such that $\pi_2(M)$ is not trivial, then there exists an embedding $S^2\to M$ such that its image homotopy class is not equal to zero. \end{thm}

This theorem was established and proved by C. Papakyriakopoulos in 1957.
