\begin{document}
Suppose that $M$ and $N$ are two differentiable manifolds
of dimension $n$ (without boundary) with $M$ compact and $N$ connected and
 suppose that
$f \colon M \to N$ is a differentiable mapping.  If $y \in N$ is a regular
value of $f$, then we denote by $\# f^{-1}(y)$ the number of points in $M$
that map to $y$.

\begin{defn}
Let $y \in N$ be a regular value, then we define the {\em degree mod 2}  of $f$ by
\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{deg}_2 f := \# f^{-1}(y) \pmod{2} .
\end{equation*}
\end{defn}

It can be shown that the degree mod 2 does not depend on the regular value $y$ that we pick so that $\operatorname{deg}_2 f$ is well defined.

This is similar to the Brouwer degree but does not require oriented manifolds.  In fact $\operatorname{deg}_2 f = \operatorname{deg} f \pmod{2}$.
