\begin{document}
From the most general -categorical- point of view, an embedding between two objects $A,B$ in a category $\cal{C}$ is a $\cal{C}$-morphism $f\colon A\to B$ which is injective. So, for example, the adjectives topological, algebraic or geometrical should be used, respectively, when we talk of embeddings between topological spaces, algebraic structures or geometries.
