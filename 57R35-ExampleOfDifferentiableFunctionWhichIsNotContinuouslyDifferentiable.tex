Let $f$ be defined in the following way:
\[
f(x)=\begin{cases}
x^2\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) & \text{if }x\neq 0\\
0 & \text{if }x=0.
\end{cases}
\]
Then if $x\neq 0$, $f'(x)=2x\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) - \cos\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$ using the usual rules for calculating derivatives.  If $x=0$, we must compute the derivative by evaluating the limit
\[
\lim_{\epsilon\to 0} \frac{f(\epsilon)-f(0)}{\epsilon}
\]
which we can simplify to 
\[
\lim_{\epsilon\to 0} \, \epsilon\sin\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right).
\]
We know $\left|\sin(x)\right|\leq 1$ for every $x$, so this limit is just $0$.  Combining this with our previous calculation, we see that
\[
f'(x)=\begin{cases}
2x\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) - \cos\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) & \text{if }x\neq 0 \\
0 & \text{if }x=0.
\end{cases}
\]
This is just a slightly modified version of the topologist's sine curve; in particular,
\[
\lim_{x\to 0} f'(x)
\]
diverges, so that $f'(x)$ is not continuous, even though it is defined for every real number.  Put another way, $f$ is differentiable but not $C^1$.
